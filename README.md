## New Features

1. **Time Subtraction on Scarecrow Hit**  
   - When the scarecrow hits the player, time is subtracted from the remaining game timer, increasing difficulty.

2. **Different Types of Pickups**  
   - Added variety to pickups beyond standard crops:
     - **Beets** â€“ worth extra points.
     - **Sunflower** â€“ restores a small amount of time.
   - These add strategic choices for the player.

## Arrow Functions, `this`, and `bind`

- **Arrow Functions**  
  - Used in event listeners to preserve `this` context:
    ```javascript
    if (this.ui.start) this.ui.start.addEventListener("click", () => this.start());
    ```
    - `this` refers to the `Game` instance, not the button element.

- **`.bind(this)`**  
  - Used when passing class methods as callbacks:
    ```javascript
    this._onKeyDown = this.onKeyDown.bind(this);
    ```
    - Ensures `this` refers to the `Input` instance rather than the global object.

- **How It Works**  
  - Normal functions have their own `this`, which can change depending on how the function is called.  
  - Arrow functions inherit `this` from their enclosing context (lexical scope).  
  - `.bind(this)` explicitly sets `this` for a function when called.
